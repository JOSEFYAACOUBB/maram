# Image Placement Guide

To complete the website, you'll need to add these images to the root folder (same location as index.html):

## Required Images:

### 1. Hero Section
- **maram-photo.jpg** (400x500px recommended)
  - Main profile photo for the hero section
  - Should be high-quality portrait
  - Preferably with good lighting and professional look

### 2. About Section  
- **maram-about.jpg** (300x300px recommended)
  - Casual or lifestyle photo
  - Will be displayed in polaroid style frame
  - Can be more relaxed/candid

### 3. Gallery Section
- **gallery1.jpg** (350x350px recommended) - Fashion shoot
- **gallery2.jpg** (350x350px recommended) - Editorial style
- **gallery3.jpg** (350x350px recommended) - Portrait
- **gallery4.jpg** (350x350px recommended) - Commercial/beauty

## Image Tips:
- Use high-resolution images (at least 1000px width)
- JPG format is recommended for photos
- Ensure good lighting and quality
- The website will automatically resize and optimize display

## Temporary Placeholders:
Until you add the actual photos, the website will show broken image icons. The layout and animations will still work perfectly!

## File Location:
Place all images directly in the main folder:
